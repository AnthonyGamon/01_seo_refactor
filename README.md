In this project I added semantic HTML elements such as <article>, <aside>, <details>,
<figure>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <nav> and <section> instead of <div>. I structured the elemtns to follow logical structure. All images have been given alt attributes to give a definition of what they are. Everything falls in a sequential order. I also gave the html file a title element. Lastly I updated the CSS file to consolidate everything to have a cleaner look.
